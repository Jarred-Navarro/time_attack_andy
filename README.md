Thank you for playing my game! :) I hope you enjoy!

** NOTE ON PROJECT HISTORY **
The current repository does not reflect the whole development history of Time Attack Andy.

This was my first ever game, and it was created for my final project in CSC 237 at Adelphi University. It was meant to demonstrate my skills and proficiency with
using the Arcade library in Python, alongside other tools (such as Tiled) to create a game from the ground up.

I was a Math Major and Computer Science Minor in my undergraduate program, and this was the second major programming assignment I had taken. As such, I had no prior experience with GitHub. Since then I've learned how to make use of git, and will track all future changes of the game through this repository.
